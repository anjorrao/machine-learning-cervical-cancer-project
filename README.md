# Comparative analysis of various non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques for cervical cancer prediction.

### In this project, we implemented non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Isometric mapping (ISOMAP), Locally-linear embedding (LLE) ,T-Distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (T-SNE) on classification models i.e. Logistic regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), and evaluate and analyze the results generated by each model and anticipate whether a patient has cervical cancer from given datasheet.
